        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms about the language.
        <br>
        Using CSS you can control exactly how HTML elements look in the browser, presenting your markup using whatever design you like.

      <p>
        As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.
        <br>
        A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.
        <br>
        Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge , are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer.
        <br>
        CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be used to create layout — for example turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation. Have a look at the links in this paragraph for specific examples.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section">
      <header id="CSS_syntax">CSS syntax</header>
      <p>
        CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. For example "I want the main heading on my page to be shown as large red text."
        <br>
        The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above:
      </p>
      <code>
        h1 {
        color: red;
        font-size: 5em;
        }
      </code>
      <p>
        The rule opens with a selector . This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case we are styling level one headings (&lt; h1 &gt;).
          <br>
          We then have a set of curly braces { }. Inside those will be one or more declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs. Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting, then a value that we'd like to give the property.
          <br>
          Before the colon, we have the property, and after the colon, the value. CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified. In our example, we have the color property, which can take various color values. We also have the font-size property. This property can take various size units as a value.
          <br>
          A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other.
        </p>
        <code>
          h1 {
            color: red;
            font-size: 5em;
          }
          <br>
          p {
            color: black;
          }
        </code>
        <p>
          You will find that you quickly learn some values, whereas others you will need to look up. The individual property pages on MDN give you a quick way to look up properties and their values when you forget, or want to know what else you can use as a value.
        </p>
      </section>

        <p>
          As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the language is broken down into modules. You'll see reference to these modules as you explore MDN and many of the documentation pages are organized around a particular module. For example, you could take a look at the MDN reference to the Backgrounds and Borders module to find out what its purpose is, and what different properties and other features it contains. You will also find links to the CSS Specification that defines the technology (see below).
          <br>
          At this stage you don't need to worry too much about how CSS is structured, however it can make it easier to find information if, for example, you are aware that a certain property is likely to be found among other similar things and are therefore probably in the same specification.
          <br>
          For a specific example, let's go back to the Backgrounds and Borders module — you might think that it makes logical sense for the background-color and border-color properties to be defined in this module. And you'd be right.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS is no different — it is developed by a group within the W3C called the CSS Working Group. This group is made of representatives of browser vendors and other companies who have an interest in CSS. There are also other people, known as invited experts, who act as independent voices; they are not linked to a member organization.
          <br>
          New CSS features are developed, or specified, by the CSS Working Group. Sometimes because a particular browser is interested in having some capability, other times because web designers and developers are asking for a feature, and sometimes because the Working Group itself has identified a requirement. CSS is constantly developing, with new features coming available. However, a key thing about CSS is that everyone works very hard to never change things in a way that would break old websites. A website built in 2000, using the limited CSS available then, should still be usable in a browser today!
          <br>
          As a newcomer to CSS, it is likely that you will find the CSS specs overwhelming — they are intended for engineers to use to implement support for the features in user agents, not for web developers to read to understand CSS. Many experienced developers would much rather refer to MDN documentation or other tutorials. It is however worth knowing that they exist, understanding the relationship between the CSS you are using, browser support (see below), and the specs.

          Once CSS has been specified then it is only useful for us in developing web pages if one or more browsers have implemented it. This means that the code has been written to turn the instruction in our CSS file into something that can be output to the screen. We'll look at this process more in the lesson How CSS works. It is unusual for all browsers to implement a feature at the same time, and so there is usually a gap where you can use some part of CSS in some browsers and not in others. For this reason, being able to check implementation status is useful. On each property page on MDN you can see the status of the property you are interested in, so you can tell if you will be able to use it on a website.

          When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content with its style information. It processes the document in a number of stages, which we've listed below. Bear in mind that this is a very simplified version of what happens when a browser loads a webpage, and that different browsers will handle the process in different ways. But this is roughly what happens.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The browser loads the HTML (e.g. receives it from the network).
          </li>
          <li>
            It converts the HTML into a DOM (Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the computer's memory. The DOM is explained in a bit more detail in the next section.
          </li>
          <li>
            The browser then fetches most of the resources that are linked to by the HTML document, such as embedded images and videos ... and linked CSS! JavaScript is handled a bit later on in the process, and we won't talk about it here to keep things simpler.
          </li>
          <li>
            The browser parses the fetched CSS, and sorts the different rules by their selector types into different "buckets", e.g. element, class, ID, and so on. Based on the selectors it finds, it works out which rules should be applied to which nodes in the DOM, and attaches style to them as required (this intermediate step is called a render tree).
          </li>
          <li>
            The render tree is laid out in the structure it should appear in after the rules have been applied to it.
          </li>
          <li>
            The visual display of the page is shown on the screen (this stage is called painting).
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The following diagram also offers a simple view of the process.
        </p>

        <header id="About_the_DOM">About the DOM</header>
        <p>
          A DOM has a tree-like structure. Each element, attribute, and piece of text in the markup language becomes a DOM node in the tree structure. The nodes are defined by their relationship to other DOM nodes. Some elements are parents of child nodes, and child nodes have siblings.
          <br>
          Understanding the DOM helps you design, debug and maintain your CSS because the DOM is where your CSS and the document's content meet up. When you start working with browser DevTools you will be navigating the DOM as you select items in order to see which rules apply.

      <p>
        Let's say we added some CSS to our document, to style it. Again, the HTML is as follows:
      </p>
      <code>
        &lt;p&gt;
          Let's use:
          &lt;span&gt; Cascading &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span&gt; Style &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span&gt; Sheets &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
      </code>
      <p>
        Let's suppose we apply the following CSS to it:
      </p>
      <code>
        span {
          border: 1px solid black;
          background-color: lime;
        }
      </code>
      <p>
        The browser will parse the HTML and create a DOM from it, then parse the CSS. Since the only rule available in the CSS has a span selector, the browser will be able to sort the CSS very quickly! It will apply that rule to each one of the three <span>s, then paint the final visual representation to the screen.
        <br>
        The updated output is as follows:
      </p>
      <pre class="brush: css">span {
        border: 1px solid black;
        background-color: lime;
      }</pre>
      <p>
        Similarly, if a browser encounters a selector that it doesn't understand, it will just ignore the whole rule and move on to the next one.
        <br>
        In the example below I have used the British English spelling for color, which makes that property invalid as it is not recognised. So my paragraph has not been colored blue. All of the other CSS have been applied however; only the invalid line is ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
      <code>
        &lt;p&gt;
          I want this text to be large, bold and blue.
        &lt;/p&gt;
      </code>
      <code>
        /* CSS file */
        <br>
        p {
          font-weight: bold;
          colour: blue; /* incorrect spelling of the color property */
          font-size: 200%;
        }
      </code>
